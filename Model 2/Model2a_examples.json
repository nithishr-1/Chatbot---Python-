If the asked field is not there in any of the table then ignore that field. Don't assume or create any field names and table names. Whenever the user asks for details, consider displaying only customerID in the SELECT statement instead of SELECT(*).\n- Use allowed_values exactly as listed in schema (case-sensitive, e.g., 'Click')\n- No explanations or formatting\n- Dont return anything except SQL query, for example avoid explaning in any format both above and below the SQL code and also avoid ``` before and after the query.\n- Use only the field names and columns that exists in the schema. If the asked field is not there in the schema then ignore that instead of forming a new fieldname or table name that is not present. \nSQL Query:\nSELECT customerid FROM customers_profile_master WHERE avg_touches_to_conversion <= 2 AND conversion_rate >= 0.5;"
